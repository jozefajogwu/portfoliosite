## Projects
### **Impact of Used Engine Oil and Other Pollutants from Mechanic Workshops on the Physical Environment of Jos, Plateau State**
[Publication](https://jozefajogwu.medium.com/impact-of-used-engine-oil-and-other-pollutants-from-mechanic-workshops-on-the-physical-environment-149c4529dd63)

Examines automobile shops, including their geological and soil contexts, and their methods for disposing of used engine oil and other wastes such as plastics and nylon. I reviewedinformation on the environmental impacts of used motor oil, analyzing its effects on soil and aquatic organismsy.

### Decoding Physical and Cognitive Impacts of Particulate Matter Concentrations at Ultra-Fine Scales
[Publication](https://www.mdpi.com/1424-8220/22/11/4240)

Used **Matlab** to train over 100 machine learning models which estimated particulate matter concentrations based on a suite of over 300 biometric variables. We found biometric variables can be used to accurately estimate particulate matter concentrations at ultra-fine spatial scales with high fidelity (r2 = 0.91) and that smaller particles are better estimated than larger ones. Inferring environmental conditions solely from biometric measurements allows us to disentangle key interactions between the environment and the body.
